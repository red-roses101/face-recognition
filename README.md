# face-recognition
in this program we use openCV library and face recognition library along side with Numpy for mathematical calculation like the treshold value for the segmentation of the image[matrice] ;;;don't warry the program will do that you don't need to fully indrestadnt the function of that segmentation 
you need to install those libries to make it works
pip install dlib 
pip install face-recognition 
pip install opencv-python 
pip install numpy
N.B you should frist install dlib before face-recognition becouse face-recogniton is based on dlib
